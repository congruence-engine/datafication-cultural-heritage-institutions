##  Depictions of domestic appliances in magazines and the parallel emergence of gas and electricity as sources of energy

## Short summary
In the final year of the project we were seeking to focus our attention on enacting the national collection social machine in Bradford. We were looking to pay particular attention to the infrastructural set up of the social machine - how the technical set up and social relationships enable researchers, institutions and interested parties to make connections between collections and undertake new inquiries. This was trialled by organising 6 workshops with partners in Bradford. Most were organised in conjunction with one of the other investigations.
